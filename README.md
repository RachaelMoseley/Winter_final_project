## Overview
### Description (Business Thesis)
The Water Quality Analyzer will be used by India residents to evaluate and contrast the water quality of Indian lakes and ponds.

This analysis might be useful to others to help identify different areas in India in need of water quality improvements and to aid travelers what water to not drink from or use along their journey. 

It can also be useful to researchers studying the water qualities from these bodies of water as well.

#### Customer Target
Customer Segment: Residential, Government, Industrial.

#### Problems Identified
#####  Many residents in India are unaware of the quality of their water.
* Around 35 million people lack access to safe water.
* 678 million lack access to safe sanitation.
